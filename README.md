# Application task

Thank you for applying to our job offering.
In the following are a bunch of tasks which could appear in a similar kind in your upcoming workload.
The first part contains general questions.
Please answer the questions after forking this repo and keep it private.
The second part asks for a common git scenarios.
The third part requires implementation tasks.

## Part 1: Questions

Please answer the following quesitons shortly inside this file.

### Why is health data such as this especially protected by the data protection and privacy regulations?

- Healthcare data is important because it is considered as a person's 'personal property', only to be shared with consent. It's mainly used to assist patients and healthcare providers. It can be misused in a way to target a person based on his mental and physical health, take advantage of their health situation and to discriminate them. Secondly it can be used as well to increase healthcare costs for instance by controlling the chain supply of a certain medicine/drug. And used by certain groups to spread propaganda like we saw during Covid against 5g Towers!

### How do you provide animation logic in Unity-based game?

- I have not worked in Unity but I can explain how they generally work! E.g you have a Lottie animation (a library with a set of premade animations) So you would import it in your project or copy it as a js/dart/svg file and place it in your UI. Then you create an Animation controller for it that will controll its speed, animation type e.g linear, fade in, fade out, bouncy, spring etc... Loop it or triger its steps based on a condition for instance on a press of a button.

### Please explain how file permissions work in Linux. What different kinds of permissions are there? How are they assigned to a file or directory?

- I have no experience with a Linux based system/os. I can again generally explain how permissions work in ios/android apps. For any permission to add it inside Android Manifest file or .plst file in Ios. Then whenever you need to use something that requires those permissions you would call them on that trigger e.g Getting user location before you open a Maps based app. Once the user allows that permission it will be cached by the system untill the app is uninstalled. If user doesn't allow them then they would manually have to allow them by going to settings of that app or the button/app won't render.
  There are many permissions mainly 1) Location 2) Notification 3) Read and Write file 4) Camera 5) Microphone

## Part 2: Git skills

Git is a common tool to keep track of code development and collaborative programming.
Before continuing please commit your answers so far, thanks.

### Git merge

If you check the branches of this repository you will recognize another branch.
Please merge the branch and its containing files into your main branch.
Resolve possible merge conflicts.

## Part 3: Simple demo app

### Implementation task

Create an android app which allows the user to register a patient with firstname, lastname, date of birth, weight, shoesize.
Additionally the app should instruct the user to take four pictures of the patients feet, the top and bottom per foot.
The backend can be mocked and does not have to be implemented by you. However, it should ideally be a REST API endpoint.
